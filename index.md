## Short bio

I'm Astemir Boziev, working as full-time QA Automation Engineer and also I'm teaching kids how to code on Python. Recently I started my jorney into iOS development. My first project is called **Simple Anki**. This app is intended for people who are learning a new language and who need to memorize a large number of words in a foreign language.
